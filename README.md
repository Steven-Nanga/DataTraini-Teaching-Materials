# DataTrain Teaching Materials
This repository houses the teaching materials I use at DataTrain. It serves as a central hub for sharing and evolving the curriculum I deliver to students.

## What you'll find here:

- Course materials: Organized folders containing lesson plans, slides, code examples, and any other resources used in my DataTrain courses.
- Structured learning: A well-defined folder structure ensures easy navigation and access to specific course content.
- Collaborative environment: Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute by creating pull requests or opening issues if you have suggestions or improvements.
This repository is intended to be an open and collaborative space for anyone interested in the materials used at DataTrain. Whether you're a current student, a fellow instructor, or simply curious about the curriculum, feel free to browse and learn!
